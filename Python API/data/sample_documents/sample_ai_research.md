# Sample AI Research Document

## Introduction

This is a sample document for testing the RAG pipeline. It contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. Key concepts include:

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data. Popular architectures include:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
3. Transformers for natural language processing

## Natural Language Processing

NLP enables computers to understand and generate human language. Recent advances include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Semantic search and embeddings

## Conclusion

AI and machine learning continue to evolve rapidly, with new techniques and applications emerging regularly.
